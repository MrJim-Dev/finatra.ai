# RLS (Row Level Security) Issues and Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis

Your Supabase application is experiencing `PGRST116` errors ("JSON object requested, multiple (or no) rows returned") because several tables have Row Level Security (RLS) enabled but are missing critical policies that allow users to access their own data.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. **CUSTOMERS Table** (MOST CRITICAL)

- **Status**: RLS enabled but **NO POLICIES AT ALL**
- **Impact**: Complete access blocked - this is likely the main cause of your errors
- **Fix Required**: Add comprehensive CRUD policy for owners

### 2. **PORTFOLIO Table**

- **Status**: RLS enabled, has READ and INSERT policies
- **Missing**: UPDATE and DELETE policies
- **Impact**: Users can't modify or delete their portfolios

### 3. **ACCOUNT_GROUPS Table**

- **Status**: RLS enabled, has READ and INSERT policies
- **Missing**: UPDATE and DELETE policies
- **Impact**: Users can't modify or delete their account groups

### 4. **ACCOUNTS Table**

- **Status**: RLS enabled, has READ and INSERT policies
- **Missing**: UPDATE and DELETE policies
- **Impact**: Users can't modify or delete their accounts

### 5. **SUBSCRIPTIONS Table**

- **Status**: RLS enabled, has READ policy only
- **Missing**: INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE policies
- **Impact**: Users can't manage their subscriptions

### 6. **TRANSACTIONS & TRANSACTION_ALT Tables**

- **Status**: RLS disabled (potential security risk)
- **Recommendation**: Enable RLS and add proper policies

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Run SQL Commands Directly

1. Go to your Supabase Dashboard
2. Navigate to SQL Editor
3. Copy and paste the contents of `fix_rls_policies.sql`
4. Execute the SQL commands

### Option 2: Create Development Branch (Recommended for Production)

If you're working on a production database, consider:

1. Creating a Supabase development branch (~$10/month)
2. Testing the fixes on the branch first
3. Merging changes to production once verified

## Expected Results After Fix

- ✅ `PGRST116` errors should disappear
- ✅ Users will be able to access their own data
- ✅ Full CRUD operations will work for data owners
- ✅ Security will be maintained (users can only access their own data)

## Tables with Complete RLS Policies (No Action Needed)

- **categories**: Has all CRUD policies ✅
- **chats**: Has comprehensive policies ✅
- **prices**: Has public read access ✅
- **products**: Has public read access ✅

## Additional Security Recommendations

1. **Enable RLS on transactions tables** for better security
2. **Test thoroughly** after applying changes
3. **Monitor logs** to ensure no new permission errors
4. **Consider using development branches** for future schema changes

## Priority Order for Fixes

1. **CUSTOMERS table** (fix immediately - blocking all access)
2. **PORTFOLIO, ACCOUNTS, ACCOUNT_GROUPS** (enable full CRUD)
3. **SUBSCRIPTIONS** (enable user management)
4. **TRANSACTIONS tables** (enable RLS for security)
5. **PRICES/PRODUCTS** (add management policies if needed)

Run the fixes in the provided SQL file to resolve all these issues.
