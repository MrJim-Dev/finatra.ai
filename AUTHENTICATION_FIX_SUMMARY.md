# 🔧 Authentication Fix Summary

## 🚨 Root Cause: Client-Side Supabase Used in Server Context

The main issue causing your `PGRST116` "0 rows" errors was **authentication context loss** due to incorrect Supabase client usage.

### **What Was Wrong:**

1. **`lib/portfolio.ts`** was using **client-side** Supabase (`./supabase/client`)
2. **`lib/project.ts`** was using **server-side** Supabase but **without awaiting** `createClient()`
3. **`lib/upvote.ts`** had similar issues with missing `await` calls
4. But all were being called from **server-side** dashboard pages
5. This caused JWT token loss in the server context
6. `auth.uid()` returned `null` in RLS policies
7. RLS blocked all data access → **"0 rows" errors**

### **Critical Issue Pattern:**

```typescript
// ❌ WRONG - This was in lib/portfolio.ts
import { createClient } from './supabase/client'; // Client-side

export async function getPortfolioBySlug(slug: string) {
  const supabase = createClient(); // No JWT token in server context
  // ... database query fails due to RLS
}
```

```typescript
// ❌ ALSO WRONG - This was in lib/project.ts
import { createClient } from './supabase/server'; // Server-side import

export async function getProjectBySlug(slug: string) {
  const supabase = createClient(); // ← Missing await!
  // ... database query fails due to RLS
}
```

```typescript
// ✅ FIXED - Now properly using server-side client
import { createClient } from './supabase/server'; // Server-side

export async function getPortfolioBySlug(slug: string) {
  const supabase = await createClient(); // JWT token properly passed
  // ... database query works with RLS
}
```

## 🛠️ Fixes Applied

### 1. **Fixed Portfolio Service** (`lib/portfolio.ts`)

- ✅ Changed from client-side to server-side Supabase client
- ✅ Added proper `await` for server client initialization
- ✅ Now properly passes JWT tokens to database

### 2. **Fixed Project Service** (`lib/project.ts`)

- ✅ Added missing `await` calls for all `createClient()` instances
- ✅ Fixed functions: `getProjectBySlug`, `getPublicProjects`, `getProjectsByUserId`, `getFeaturesByProjectId`, `getFeatureByProjectSlug`, `getUpdatedVotesPerFeature`, `getFeatureComments`, `getBookmarkedProjects`
- ✅ Fixed `getPublicUrl` function signature and calls
- ✅ Added proper TypeScript type annotations

### 3. **Fixed Upvote Service** (`lib/upvote.ts`)

- ✅ Added missing `await` calls for `createClient()`
- ✅ Moved supabase client creation inside try-catch blocks
- ✅ Fixed functions: `checkUserUpvote`, `handleUpvote`, `getUpvoteCount`, `updateFeatureUpvoteCount`

### 4. **Added Authentication Guards**

Applied to all dashboard pages:

- ✅ `app/(app)/dashboard/[slug]/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/(app)/dashboard/[slug]/accounts/page.tsx`
- ✅ `app/(app)/dashboard/[slug]/categories/page.tsx`

```typescript
// ✅ Authentication check added to all pages
const { user } = await getUser();
if (!user) {
  redirect('/signin');
}
```

### 5. **Fixed TypeScript Errors**

- ✅ Added proper type annotations to reduce functions
- ✅ Fixed parameter type issues in accounts page
- ✅ Added `any` types for complex data structures

## 🔍 Why This Happened

### **Supabase Client Context Issue:**

- **Client-side client**: Uses browser cookies/localStorage, works in browser
- **Server-side client**: Uses HTTP cookies, works in Next.js server components
- **Missing await**: Server client returns Promise, needs to be awaited for proper initialization
- **Mixed usage**: Client-side client can't access server cookies → no authentication

### **RLS Behavior:**

- When `auth.uid()` returns `null` (unauthenticated)
- RLS policies block all access for security
- Database returns 0 rows instead of data
- Results in `PGRST116` errors

## ✅ Expected Results

After these fixes:

- ✅ JWT tokens properly passed to database
- ✅ `auth.uid()` returns correct user ID in RLS policies
- ✅ Users can access their own data
- ✅ `PGRST116` errors should disappear
- ✅ Dashboard pages load with proper data
- ✅ All database queries work with authentication context

## 🔒 Security Benefits

Your RLS policies are now working correctly:

- Users can only see their own portfolios
- Users can only access their own accounts
- Users can only access their own projects and features
- Users can only modify their own data
- Unauthorized users are redirected to signin

## 📝 Additional Recommendations

### 1. **Verify All Lib Files**

We've fixed the main lib files, but check any other custom lib files for similar patterns.

### 2. **Environment Variables**

Ensure these are set:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
```

### 3. **Middleware Verification**

Your middleware looks correct, but ensure it's running on all protected routes.

### 4. **Test Authentication Flow**

1. Sign out completely
2. Try to access dashboard pages
3. Should redirect to `/signin`
4. Sign in and verify data loads correctly

## 🐛 Debugging Commands

If you still see issues, check:

```sql
-- In Supabase SQL Editor
SELECT auth.uid(); -- Should return user ID when authenticated
```

```typescript
// In your components
console.log('User:', await getUser());
console.log('Auth UID:', await supabase.auth.getUser());
```

## 🎯 Key Takeaway

**Always use the correct Supabase client with proper async/await:**

- 🖥️ **Server components**: Use `@/lib/supabase/server` with `await createClient()`
- 🌐 **Client components**: Use `@/lib/supabase/client` with `createClient()` (no await)
- 🚫 **Never mix**: Client-side clients won't work in server context
- ⚠️ **Always await**: Server-side createClient() returns a Promise

This was a classic Next.js + Supabase authentication context issue, not a problem with your RLS policies themselves!

## 📊 Files Fixed

### Complete Fixes Applied:

1. ✅ `lib/portfolio.ts` - Fixed client/server usage + await
2. ✅ `lib/project.ts` - Fixed missing await calls + types
3. ✅ `lib/upvote.ts` - Fixed missing await calls
4. ✅ `app/(app)/dashboard/[slug]/page.tsx` - Added auth guards
5. ✅ `app/(app)/dashboard/[slug]/accounts/page.tsx` - Added auth guards + types
6. ✅ `app/(app)/dashboard/[slug]/categories/page.tsx` - Added auth guards

### Already Correct:

- ✅ `lib/auth.ts` - Already using server client correctly
- ✅ `lib/supabase/server.ts` - Correct implementation
- ✅ `lib/supabase/client.ts` - Correct implementation
- ✅ `middleware.ts` - Correct setup
